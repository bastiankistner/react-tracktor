# react-tracktor ðŸšœ

`<Tracktor />` is a React render prop, inspired by [react-tracking](https://github.com/nytimes/react-tracking), to gradually build tracking data down the render tree. At each level, all data is available from "above" while also passing it "down". It provides several ways to trigger tracking events.

## Caveats

- This library only works with React versions that support [hooks](https://reactjs.org/hooks). That means `16.8.0` and up.
- This library uses the [IntersectionObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) Browser API under the hood. This feature might not work without a polyfill for older browsers.

## Installation

```bash
yarn add react-tracktor
```

or

```bash
npm install react-tracktor
```
